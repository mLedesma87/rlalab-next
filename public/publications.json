        "abstractText": "Rhodotorula toruloides is a potential chassis for microbial cell factories as this yeast can metabolise different substrates into a diverse range of natural products, but the lack of efficient synthetic biology tools hinders its applicability. In this study, the modular, versatile and efficient Golden Gate DNA assembly system (RtGGA) was adapted to the first basidiomycete, an oleaginous yeast R. toruloides. R. toruloides CCT 0783 was sequenced, and used for the GGA design. The DNA fragments were assembled with predesigned 4-nt overhangs and a library of standardized parts was created containing promoters, genes, terminators, insertional regions, and resistance genes. The library was combined to create cassettes for the characterization of promoters strength and to overexpress the carotenoid production pathway. A variety of reagents, plasmids, and strategies were used and the RtGGA proved to be robust. The RtGGA was used to build three versions of the carotenoid overexpression cassette by using different promoter combinations. The cassettes were transformed into R. toruloides and the three new strains were characterized. Total carotenoid concentration increased by 41%. The dedicated GGA platform fills a gap in the advanced genome engineering toolkit for R. toruloides, enabling the efficient design of complex metabolic pathways.",

Microbial biosynthesis of fatty acids follows the trend of sustainable development, as it enables green, environmentally friendly and efficient production. As a natural oleaginous yeast, Yarrowia lipolytica is especially well-suited for the production of fatty acids. Moreover, it has a variety of genetic engineering tools and novel metabolic engineering strategies that make it a robust workhorse for the production of an array of value-added products. In this review, we summarize recent advances in metabolic engineering strategies for accumulating nutritional fatty acids in Y. lipolytica, including conjugated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, the future prospects of nutritional fatty acid production using the Y. lipolytica platform are discussed in light of the current progress, challenges, and trends in this field.

In this review, we introduce the most cutting-edge developments in synthetic biology tools for Y. lipolytica, as well as the recent progress in harnessing these tools to engineer the Y. lipolytica chassis to overaccumulate various unusual fatty acids, including odd-chain fatty acids, conjugated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, cyclopropane fatty acids, methyl-branched fatty acids, hydroxylated fatty acids, and medium chain fatty acids.

Synthetic yeast consortia, simple or complex synthetic mixed cultures, have been used for the production of various metabolites. Cooperation between the members of a consortium and cross-feeding can be applied to create stable microbial communication. These consortia can: consume a variety of substrates, perform more complex functions, produce metabolites in high titer, rate, and yield (TRY), and show higher stability during industrial fermentations. Due to the new research context of synthetic consortia, few yeasts were used to build these consortia, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, and Yarrowia lipolytica. Here, application of the yeasts for design of synthetic microbial consortia and their advantages and bottlenecks for effective and robust production of valuable metabolites from bioresource, including: cellulose, xylose, glycerol and so on, have been reviewed. Key trends and challenges are also discussed for the future development of synthetic yeast consortia.",

        "abstractText": "CRISPR gene activation and inhibition (CRISPRai) has become a powerful synthetic tool for influencing the expression of native genes for foundational studies, cellular reprograming, and metabolic engineering. Here we develop a method for near leak-free, inducible expression of a polycistronic array containing up to 24 gRNAs from two orthogonal CRISPR/Cas systems to increase CRISPRai multiplexing capacity and target gene flexibility. To achieve strong inducibility, we created a technology to silence gRNA expression within the array in the absence of the inducer, since we found that long gRNA arrays for CRISPRai can express themselves even without promoter. Using this method, we create a highly tuned and easy-to-use CRISPRai toolkit in the industrially relevant yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, establishing the first system to combine simultaneous activation and repression, large multiplexing capacity, and inducibility. We demonstrate this platform by targeting 11 genes in central metabolism in a single transformation, achieving a 45-fold increase in succinic acid, which could be precisely controlled in an inducible manner. Our method offers a highly effective way to regulate genes and rewire metabolism in yeast, with principles of gRNA array construction and inducibility that should extend to other chassis organisms.",

Fatty acids with different carbon chain lengths including short- (&lt;C6), medium- (C6&ndash;C12), long- (C14&ndash;C20), and very-long- (&gt;C20), with either even or odd number of carbons, have significantly different characteristics and wide applications in energy, material, medicine, and nutrition. Tailoring chain-length specificity of these compounds using metabolic engineering would be of high interest. Yarrowia lipolytica, as an oleaginous yeast, is a superior industrial chassis for the production of tailored chain-length fatty acids and their derivatives due to its hyper-oil-producing capability. In this Review, we cover metabolic engineering approaches that can lead to fatty acid chain length control in this microorganism. These approaches involve the manipulation of the fatty acid synthase, the thioesterase, the &beta;-oxidation pathway, the elongation and desaturation pathway, the polyketide synthase-like polyunsaturated fatty acid synthase pathway, and the odd-chain fatty acids synthesis pathway. Finally, we also discuss alternative strategies that can be used in the future to tailored chain-length control.",

        "abstractText": "The evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has highlighted the need for versatile diagnostic assays that can discriminate among emerging variants of the virus. Here we report the development and performance benchmarking of an inexpensive (approximately US$0.30 per test) assay for the rapid (sample-to-answer time within 30&thinsp;min) colorimetric detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The assay, which we integrated into foldable paper strips, leverages nucleic acid strand-displacement reactions, the thermodynamic energy penalty associated with single-base-pair mismatches and the metal-ion-controlled enzymatic cleavage of urea to amplify the recognition of viral RNAs for the colorimetric readout of changes in pH via a smartphone. For 50 throat swab samples, the assay simultaneously detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and mutations specific to the SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha, Beta and Gamma, with 100% concordance with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and RNA sequencing. Customizable and inexpensive paper-based assays for the detection of viruses and their variants may facilitate viral surveillance.",

        "abstractText": "SARS-CoV-2 is one of the greatest threats to global human health. Point-of-care diagnostic tools for SARS-CoV-2 could facilitate rapid therapeutic intervention and mitigate transmission. In this work, we report CRISPR-Cas13a cascade-based viral RNA (Cas13C) assay for label-free and isothermal determination of SARS-CoV-2 and its mutations in clinical samples. Cas13a/crRNA was utilized to directly recognize the target of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and the recognition events sequentially initiate the transcription amplification to produce light-up RNA aptamers for output fluorescence signal. The recognition of viral RNA via Cas13a-guide RNA ensures a high specificity to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as well as viral mutations. A post transcription amplification strategy was triggered after CRISPR-Cas13a recognition contributes to an amplification cascade that achieves high sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with a limit of detection of 0.216 fM. In addition, the Cas13C assay could be able to discriminate single-nucleotide mutation, which was proven with N501Y in SARS-Cov-2 variant. This method was validated by a 100% agreement with RT-qPCR results from 12 clinical throat swab specimens. The Cas13C assay has the potential to be used as a routine nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 virus in resource-limited regions.",

        "abstractText": "BackgroundLow-cost sustainable feedstocks are essential for commercially viable biotechnologies. These feedstocks, often derived from plant or food waste, contain a multitude of different complex biomolecules which require multiple enzymes to hydrolyse and metabolise. Current standard biotechnology uses monocultures in which a single host expresses all the proteins required for the consolidated bioprocess. However, these hosts have limited capacity for expressing proteins before growth is impacted. This limitation may be overcome by utilising division of labour (DOL) in a consortium, where each member expresses a single protein of a longer degradation pathway.ResultsHere, we model a two-strain consortium, with one strain expressing an endohydrolase and a second strain expressing an exohydrolase, for cooperative degradation of a complex substrate. Our results suggest that there is a balance between increasing expression to enhance degradation versus the burden that higher expression causes. Once a threshold of burden is reached, the consortium will consistently perform better than an equivalent single-cell monoculture.ConclusionsWe demonstrate that resource-aware whole-cell models can be used to predict the benefits and limitations of using consortia systems to overcome burden. Our model predicts the region of expression where DOL would be beneficial for growth on starch, which will assist in making informed design choices for this, and other, complex-substrate degradation pathways.",

        "abstractText": "Dynamic regulation is an effective strategy for control of gene expression in microbial cell factories. In some pathway contexts, several metabolic modules must be controlled in a time dependent or ordered manner to maximize production, while the creation of genetic circuits with ordered regulation capacity still remains a great challenge. In this work, we develop a pathway independent and programmable system that enables multi-modular ordered control of metabolism in Bacillus subtilis. First, a series of thermosensors were created and engineered to expand their thresholds. Then we designed single-input-multi-output circuits for ordered control based on the use of thermosensors with different transition points. Meanwhile, a repression circuit was constructed by combining CRISPRi-based NOT gates. As a proof-of-concept, these genetic circuits were applied for multi-modular ordered control of 2&prime;-fucosyllactose (2&prime;-FL) biosynthesis, resulting in a production of 1839.7 mg/l in shake flask, which is 5.16-times that of the parental strain. In a 5-l bioreactor, the 2&prime;-FL titer reached 28.2 g/l with down-regulation of autolysis. Taken together, this work provides programmable and versatile thermosensitive genetic toolkits for dynamic regulation in B. subtilis and a multi-modular ordered control framework that can be used to improve metabolic modules in other chassis cells and for other compounds.",

Here we engineer baker&rsquo;s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a chassis for the de novo production of rubusoside and rebaudiosides. In this process, we identify multiple issues that limit the production, including rate-liming steps, product stress on cellular fitness and unbalanced metabolic networks. We carry out a systematic engineering strategy to solve these issues, which produces rubusoside and rebaudiosides at titers of 1368.6&thinsp;mg/L and 132.7&thinsp;mg/L, respectively.

This configuration allows for more efficient nutrient absorption in the infant gut. However, the fat used in most infant formulas originates from plants, which exclude palmitic acid from the sn-2 position. Oleaginous yeasts provide an alternative source of lipids for human nutrition. However, these yeasts also exclude palmitic acid from the sn-2 position of their triacylglycerol. Here we show that Yarrowia lipolytica can be engineered to produce triacylglycerol with more than 60% of the palmitic acid in the sn-2 position, by expression of lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases with palmitoyl-Coenzyme A specificity. The engineered Y. lipolytica strains can be cultured on glycerol, glucose, palm oil or a mixture of substrates, under nitrogen limited condition, to produce triacylglycerol with a fatty acid composition that resembles human milk fat, in terms of the major molecular species (palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids). Culture on palm oil or a mixture of glucose and palm oil produced the highest lipid titre and a triacylglycerol composition that is most similar with human milk fat. Our data show that an oleaginous yeast can be engineered to produce a human milk fat substitute (&beta;-palmitate), that could be used as an ingredient in infant formulas.",

        "abstractText": "Oleic acid is widely applied in the chemical, material, nutritional, and pharmaceutical industries. However, the current production of oleic acid via high oleic plant oils is limited by the long growth cycle and climatic constraints. Moreover, the global demand for high oleic plant oils, especially the palm oil, has emerged as the driver of tropical deforestation causing tropical rainforest destruction, climate change, and biodiversity loss. In the present study, an alternative and sustainable strategy for high oleic oil production was established by reprogramming the metabolism of the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica using a two-layer &quot;push-pull-block&quot; strategy. Specifically, the fatty acid synthesis pathway was first engineered to increase oleic acid proportion by altering the fatty acid profiles. Then, the content of storage oils containing oleic acid was boosted by engineering the synthesis and degradation pathways of triacylglycerides. The strain resulting from this two-layer engineering strategy produced the highest titer of high oleic microbial oil reaching 56 g/L with 84% oleic acid in fed-batch fermentation, representing a remarkable improvement of a 110-fold oil titer and 2.24-fold oleic acid proportion compared with the starting strain. This alternative and sustainable method for high oleic oil production shows the potential of substitute planting.",

Recently, electrochemical control of gene expression has been demonstrated in electrogenetic systems (redox-responsive promoters used alongside redox inducers and electrodes), allowing for the direct integration of electronics with biological processes. However, use of electrogenetic systems is limited by poor activity, tunability and standardisation. In this work we developed a strong, unidirectional, redox-responsive promoter before deriving a mutant promoter library with a spectrum of strengths. We constructed genetic circuits with these parts and demonstrated their activation by multiple classes of redox molecules. Finally, we demonstrated electrochemical activation of gene expression in aerobic conditions using a novel, modular bioelectrochemical device. These genetic and electrochemical tools facilitate the design and improve the performance of electrogenetic systems. Furthermore, the genetic design strategies used can be applied to other redox-responsive promoters to further expand the available tools for electrogenetics.",

        "abstractText": "Cost-effective microbial conversion processes of renewable feedstock into biofuels and biochemicals are of utmost importance for the establishment of a robust bioeconomy. Conventional baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, widely employed in biotechnology for decades, lacks many of the desired traits for such bioprocesses like utilization of complex carbon sources or low tolerance towards challenging conditions. Many non-conventional yeasts (NCY) present these capabilities, and they are therefore forecasted to play key roles in future biotechnological production processes. For successful implementation of NCY in biotechnology, several challenges including generation of alternative carbon sources, development of tailored NCY and optimization of the fermentation conditions are crucial for maximizing bioproduct yields and titers. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach that is facilitated through the 'YEAST4BIO' COST action. YEAST4BIO fosters integrative investigations aimed at filling knowledge gaps and excelling research and innovation, which can improve biotechnological conversion processes from renewable resources to mitigate climate change and boost transition towards a circular bioeconomy. In this perspective, the main challenges and research efforts within YEAST4BIO are discussed, highlighting the importance of collaboration and knowledge exchange for progression in this research field.",

Advances in next generation sequencing have enabled rapid and large-scale quantification of the composition of microbial communities in health and disease. Microorganisms mediate diverse host responses including metabolic pathways and immune responses. Using a system biology approach to further understand the underlying alterations of the microbiota in physiological and pathological states, can help reveal potential novel therapeutic and diagnostic interventions within the field of synthetic biology. Tools such as biosensors, memory arrays and engineered bacteria can rewire the microbiome environment. In this article, were view the computational tools used to study microbiome communities and the current limitations of these methods. We evaluate how genome-scale metabolic models can advance our understanding of the microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions. Moreover, we present how synergies between these system biology approaches and synthetic biology can be harnessed in human microbiome studies to improve future therapeutics and diagnostics and highlight important knowledge gaps for future research in these rapidly evolving fields.",

However, native pathways to utilize these substrates are absent in most biotechnologically relevant microorganisms. Recent advances in synthetic biology, genome engineering and laboratory evolution are enabling the first steps towards the creation of synthetic C1-utilizing microorganisms. Here, we briefly review the native metabolism of methane, methanol, CO2, CO and formate, and how these C1-utilizing pathways can be engineered into heterologous hosts. In addition, this review analyses the potential, the challenges and the perspectives of C1-based biomanufacturing.",

However, achieving dynamic control is not trivial, and dynamic control is difficult to obtain using simple, single-level, control strategies because they are often affected by native regulatory networks. Therefore, synthetic biologists usually apply the concept of logic gates to build more complex and multilayer genetic circuits that can process various signals and direct the metabolic flux toward the synthesis of the molecules of interest. In this review, we first summarize the applications of dynamic regulatory systems and genetic circuits and then discuss how to design multilayer genetic circuits to achieve the optimal control of metabolic fluxes in living cells.",

Microbial synthesis from glucose is an attractive alternative to chemical synthesis. In this study, we report the production of L-piperazic acid via microbial fermentation with the first engineered fungal strain of Aureobasidium melanogenum; this strain was constructed by chassis development, genetic element reconstitution and optimization, synthetic rewiring and constitutive genetic circuit reconstitution, to build a robust L-piperazic acid synthetic cascade. These genetic modifications enable A. melanogenum to directly convert glucose to L-piperazic acid without relying on the use of either chemically synthesized precursors or harsh conditions. This bio-based process overcomes the shortcomings of the conventional synthesis routes. The ultimately engineered strain is a very high-efficient cell factory that can excrete 1.12&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.05&nbsp;g l-1 of L-piperazic acid after a 120-h 10.0-l fed-batch fermentation; this is the highest titre of L-piperazic acid reported using a microbial cell factory.",

Among them, the accumulation of acetate has the largest negative impact on the fermentation performance. To address the acetate overflow caused by knocking out lactate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase, several metabolic engineering manipulations were conducted. First, acetate was reduced through enhancing the acetate assimilation pathway by overexpressing heterologous acetyl-CoA synthetase. Then, the polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis pathway was introduced to further reprogram the intracellular carbon metabolism. As a result, the best performed strain Kpr-6 produced up to 91.2 g/L extracellular 1,3-PD and 2.56 g/L intracellular PHB which can be easily separated from each other, while the acetate was dramatically reduced. The metabolic engineering strategies developed in this study would be helpful for constructing the microbial cell factory for other similar bio-based chemical production.",

KMC2) was investigated using comparative genomic tools against three publicly available reference genomes to reveal the keratinolytic potential for biosynthesis of valuable secondary metabolites. Genomic features and metabolic potential of four species were compared, showing genomic differences but similar functional categories. Eleven different secondary metabolite gene clusters of interest were mined from the four genomes successfully, including five common ones shared across all genomes. Among the common metabolites, we identified gene clusters involved in biosynthesis of flexirubin-type pigment, microviridin, and siderophore, showing remarkable conservation across the four genomes. Unique secondary metabolite gene clusters were also discovered, for example, ladderane from Chryseobacterium sp. KMC2. Additionally, this study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the potential metabolic pathways of keratin utilization in Chryseobacterium sp. KMC2, with the involvement of amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, propanoate metabolism, and sulfate reduction. This work uncovers the biosynthesis of secondary metabolite gene clusters from four keratinolytic Chryseobacterium species and shades lights on the keratinolytic potential of Chryseobacterium sp. KMC2 from a genome-mining perspective, can provide alternatives to valorize keratinous materials into high-value bioactive natural products.",

        "abstractText": "Fatty alcohols (FA-OH) are aliphatic unbranched primary alcohols with a chain of four or more carbon atoms. Besides potential industrial applications, fatty alcohols have important biological functions as well. In nature, fatty alcohols are produced as a part of a mixture of pheromones in several insect species, such as moths, termites, bees, wasps, etc. In addition, FA-OHs have a potential for agricultural applications, for example, they may be used as a suitable substitute for commercial insecticides. The insecticides have several drawbacks associated with their preparation, and they exert a negative impact on the environment. Currently, pheromone components are prepared mainly through the catalytic hydrogenation of plant oils and petrochemicals, which is an unsustainable, ecologically unfriendly, and highly expensive process. The biotechnological production of the pheromone components using engineered microbial strains and through the expression of the enzymes participating in the biosynthesis of these components is a promising approach that ensures ecological sustenance as well. The present study was aimed at evaluating the production of FA-OHs in the oleaginous yeast, Yarrowia lipolytica, with different lengths of fatty-acyl chains by expressing the fatty acyl-CoA reductase (FAR) BlapFAR4 from B. lapidarius, producing C16:0-OH, C16:1&Delta;9-OH, and lower quantities of both C14:0-OH and C18:1&Delta;9-OH, and BlucFAR1 from B. lucorum, producing FA-OHs with a chain length of 18&ndash;26 carbon atoms, in this yeast. Among the different novel Y. lipolytica strains used in the present study, the best results were obtained with JMY7086, which carried several lipid metabolism modifications and expressed the BlucFAR1 gene under the control of a strong constitutive promoter 8UAS-pTEF. JMY7086 produced only saturated fatty alcohols with chain lengths from 18 to 24 carbon atoms. The highest titer and accumulation achieved were 166.6 mg/L and 15.6 mg/g DCW of fatty alcohol",

        "abstractText": "Bacillus subtilis is a preferred microbial host for the industrial production of nutraceuticals and a promising candidate for the synthesis of functional sugars, such as N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). Previously, a GlcNAc-overproducer Bacillus subtilis SFMI was constructed using glmS ribozyme dual regulatory tool. Herein, we further engineered to enhance carbon flux from glucose towards GlcNAc synthesis. As a result, the increased flux towards GlcNAc synthesis triggered phosphosugar stress response, which caused abnormal cell growth. Unfortunately, the mechanism of phosphosugar stress response had not been elucidated in B. subtilis. In order to reveal stress mechanism and overcome its negative effect in bioproduction, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis. The results indicate that cells slow glucose utilization by repression of glucose import and accelerate catabolic reactions of phosphosugar. To verify these results, we overexpressed the phosphatase YwpJ, which relieved phosphosugar stress and allowed us to identify the enzyme responsible for GlcNAc synthesis from GlcNAc6P. In addition, the deletion of nagBB and murQ, responsible for GlcNAc precursor degradation, further improved GlcNAc synthesis. The best engineered strain, B. subtilis FMIP34, increased GlcNAc titer from 11.5 to 26.1 g/L in shake flasks and produced 87.5 g/L GlcNAc in 30-L fed-batch bioreactor. Our results not only elucidate, for the first time, the phosphosugar stress response mechanism in B. subtilis, but also demonstrate how the combination of rational metabolic engineering with novel insights into physiology and metabolism allows the construction of highly efficient microbial cell factories for the production of high value chemicals.

Over the last decade, synthetic biology has begun to be applied to bacteria that naturally produce biomaterials, in order to boost material production, change material properties and to add new functionalities to the resulting material. Recent work has used synthetic biology to engineer several Komagataeibacter strains; bacteria that naturally secrete large amounts of the versatile and promising material bacterial cellulose (BC). In this review, we summarize how genetic engineering, metabolic engineering and now synthetic biology have been used in Komagataeibacter strains to alter BC, improve its production and begin to add new functionalities into this easy-to-grow material. As well as describing the milestone advances, we also look forward to what will come next from engineering bacterial cellulose by synthetic biology.",

The aim of this study was to construct Yarrowia lipolytica strains able to produce resveratrol. For this purpose, resveratrol-biosynthesis genes from bacteria and plants were expressed in this host. Since resveratrol can be produced either via tyrosine or phenylaniline, both pathways were tested, first with a single copy and then with two copies. The phenylalanine pathway resulted in slightly higher production in glucose media, although when the media was supplemented with amino acids, the best production was found in the strain with two copies of the tyrosine pathway, which reached 0.085&nbsp;â€‹g/L. When glucose was replaced by glycerol, a preferred substrate for bioproduction, the best results, 0.104&nbsp;â€‹g/L, were obtained in a strain combining the expression of the two synthesis pathways. Finally, the best producer strain was tested in bioreactor conditions where a production of 0.43&nbsp;â€‹g/L was reached. This study suggests that Y.&nbsp;lipolytica is a promising host for resveratrol production from glycerol.",

However, while the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has very high homologous recombination (HR) efficiency, non-homologous end-joining is dominant in Y.&nbsp;lipolytica, and foreign genes are randomly inserted into the genome. Consequently, the low HR efficiency greatly restricts the genetic engineering of this yeast. In this study, RAD52, the key component of the HR machinery in S.&nbsp;cerevisiae, was grafted into Y.&nbsp;lipolytica to improve HR efficiency. The gene ade2, whose deletion can result in a brown colony phenotype, was used as the reporter gene for evaluating the HR efficiency. The HR efficiency of Y.&nbsp;lipolytica strains before and after integrating the ScRad52 gene was compared using insets with homology arms of different length. The results showed that the strategy could achieve gene targeting efficiencies of up to 95% with a homology arm length of 1000 bp, which was 6.5 times of the wildtype strain and 1.6 times of the traditionally used ku70 disruption strategy. This study will facilitate the further genetic engineering of Y.&nbsp;lipolytica to make it a more efficient cell factory for the production of value-added compounds.",

In this review, strategies for engineering four different functional cellular modules which encompass the total process of biomanufacturing are discussed, including expanding the substrate spectrum for substrate uptake modules, refactoring biosynthetic pathways and dynamic regulation for product synthesis modules, balancing energy and redox modules, and cell membrane and cell wall engineering of product storage and secretion modules. Novel strategies of integrating and coordinating different cellular modules aided by synthetic co-culturing of multiple chassis, artificial intelligence&ndash;aided data mining for guiding strain development, and the process for designing automatic chassis development via biofoundry are expected to generate next generations of model microorganism chassis for more efficient biomanufacturing.",

As an oleaginous yeast that is generally regarded as safe, Yarrowia lipolytica has been extensively studied, with large amounts of data on its lipid metabolism, genetic tools, and genome sequencing and annotation.

        "abstractText": "The recombinant strain Y. lipolytica XYL+ can utilize xylose to produce microbial lipids efficiently. However, its xylose uptake is severely delayed in the presence of d-glucose. In this study, adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) of strains in the medium containing xylose and d-glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose (dG) is performed. After four stages of evolution over a total of 64 days, for the first time, we obtained an Y. lipolytica strain (yl-XYL+*04*10) that can cometabolize xylose and glucose, with diminished glucose repression. Xylose uptake kinetics showed that it could efficiently utilize xylose in the presence of 10 g/L of dG or d-glucose. Transcriptional profiling analysis revealed that the relative expression level of xylose-specific transporter genes (encoded by YALI0_C04730g and YALI0_D00363g) was significantly upregulated. In addition, missense mutations N373T and G270A in YALI0_E23287g (encoding a d-glucose transporter) and YALI0_E15488g (encoding a hexokinase) respectively, were found. It implied that these are important gene targets responsible for improved xylose utilization in evolved Y. lipolytica.

Functional membrane microdomains (FMMs) in bacteria can provide a platform for enzyme clustering. However, the amount of FMMs at the cell basal level is still facing great challenges in multi-enzyme immobilization. Here, using the nutraceutical N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) synthesis in Bacillus subtilis as a model, we engineered FMM components to improve the enzyme assembly in FMMs. First, by overexpression of the SPFH (stomatin-prohibitin-flotillin-HflC/K) domain and YisP protein, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of squalene-derived polyisoprenoid, the membrane order of cells was increased, as verified using di-4-ANEPPDHQ staining. Then, two heterologous enzymes, GlcNAc-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (GNA1) and haloacid dehalogenase-like phosphatases (YqaB), required for GlcNAc synthesis were assembled into FMMs, and the GlcNAc titer in flask was increased to 8.30&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.57&nbsp;g/L, which was almost three times that of the control strains. Notably, FMM component modification can maintain the OD600 in stationary phase and reduce cell lysis in the later stage of fermentation. These results reveal that the improved plasma membrane ordering achieved by the engineering FMM components could not only promote the enzyme assembly into FMMs, but also improve the cell fitness.",

        "abstractText": "BackgroundXylose is the most prevalent sugar available in hemicellulose fraction of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) and of great interest for the green economy. Unfortunately, most of the cell factories cannot inherently metabolize xylose as sole carbon source. Yarrowia lipolytica is a non-conventional yeast that produces industrially important metabolites. The yeast is able to metabolize a large variety of substrates including both hydrophilic and hydrophobic carbon sources. However, Y. lipolytica lacks effective metabolic pathway for xylose uptake and only scarce information is available on utilization of xylose. For the economica feasibility of LCB-based biorefineries, effective utilization of both pentose and hexose sugars is obligatory.ResultsIn the present study, succinic acid (SA) production from xylose by Y. lipolytica was examined. To this end, Y. lipolytica PSA02004 strain was engineered by overexpressing pentose pathway cassette comprising xylose reductase (XR), xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) and xylulose kinase (XK) gene. The recombinant strain exhibited a robust growth on xylose as sole carbon source and produced substantial amount of SA. The inhibition of cell growth and SA formation was observed above 60 g/L xylose concentration. The batch cultivation of the recombinant strain in a bioreactor resulted in a maximum biomass concentration of 7.3 g/L and SA titer of 11.2 g/L with the yield of 0.19 g/g. Similar results in terms of cell growth and SA production were obtained with xylose-rich hydrolysate derived from sugarcane bagasse. The fed-batch fermentation yielded biomass concentration of 11.8 g/L (OD600: 56.1) and SA titer of 22.3 g/L with a gradual decrease in pH below 4.0. Acetic acid was obtained as a main by-product in all the fermentations.ConclusionThe recombinant strain displayed potential for bioconversion of xylose to SA. Further, this study provided a new insight on conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into value-added products. To the best of o",

Then, taking the synthesis of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in Bacillus subtilis as a proof-of-concept demonstration, we found that anchoring of various enzymes required for GlcNAc synthesis onto FMMs to obtain the FMMs-multi-enzyme complex system resulted in a significant increase in GlcNAc titer and an effectively alleviate in cell lysis at the later stage of fermentation compared to that in control strains expressing the related enzymes in the cytoplasm. Combining with metabolic model and kinetics analysis, the existence of a constructed substrate channel that maximizes the reaction efficiency is verified. In summary, we propose a novel metabolic pathway assembly model which allowed improved titers and compartmentalized flux control with high spatial resolution in bacterial metabolism.",

A recent study has described the potential of Yarrowia lipolytica as a &beta;-carotene-producing cell factory, reporting the highest titer of recombinant &beta;-carotene produced to date. Finding the best conditions to maximize production and scaling up the process to full scale, a costly and time-consuming process, it is often a bottleneck in biotechnology. In this work, we explored the benefits of using micro-fermentation equipment to significantly reduce the time spent on design and optimization of bioreaction conditions, especially in the early stages of process development. In this proof-of-concept study, a &beta;-carotene producing Y. lipolytica strain was tested in micro-fermentations partly to assess the robustness of the cell factory design and partly to perform media optimization. The medium optimization led us to an improvement of up to 50% in the yield of &beta;-carotene production in the best of the conditions. Overall, the micro-fermentation system had a high degree of reliability in all tests.",

        "abstractText": "Clostridium cellulovorans DSM 743B can produce butyrate when grown on lignocellulose, but it can hardly synthesize butanol. In a previous study, C. cellulovorans was successfully engineered to switch the metabolism from butyryl-CoA to butanol by overexpressing an alcohol aldehyde dehydrogenase gene adhE1 from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824; however, its full potential in butanol production is still unexplored. In the study, a metabolic engineering approach based on a push-pull strategy was developed to further enhance cellulosic butanol production. In order to accomplish this, the carbon flux from acetyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA was pulled by overexpressing a trans-enoyl-coenzyme A reductase gene (ter), which can irreversibly catalyze crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA. Then an acid reassimilation pathway uncoupled with acetone production was introduced to redirect the carbon flow from butyrate and acetate toward butyryl-CoA. Finally, xylose metabolism engineering was implemented by inactivating xylR (Clocel_0594) and araR (Clocel_1253), as well as overexpressing xylT (CA_C1345), which is expected to supply additional carbon and reducing power for CoA and butanol synthesis pathways. The final engineered strain produced 4.96 g/L of n-butanol from alkali extracted corn cobs (AECC), increasing by 235-fold compared to that of the wild type. It serves as a promising butanol producer by consolidated bioprocessing.",

However, achieving dynamic and autonomous up- and down-regulation of the metabolic modules of interest simultaneously, still remains a great challenge. In this work, we created an autonomous dual-control (ADC) system, by combining CRISPRi-based NOT gates with novel biosensors of a key metabolite in the pathway of interest. By sensing the levels of the intermediate glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) and self-adjusting the expression levels of the target genes accordingly with the GlcN6P biosensor and ADC system enabled feedback circuits, the metabolic flux towards the production of the high value nutraceutical N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) could be balanced and optimized in Bacillus subtilis. As a result, the GlcNAc titer in a 15-l fed-batch bioreactor increased from 59.9 g/l to 97.1 g/l with acetoin production and 81.7 g/l to 131.6 g/l without acetoin production, indicating the robustness and stability of the synthetic circuits in a large bioreactor system. Remarkably, this self-regulatory methodology does not require any external level of control such as the use of inducer molecules or switching fermentation/environmental conditions.

        "abstractText": "Microbial oils are regarded as promising alternatives to fossil fuels as concerns over environmental issues and energy production systems continue to mount. Odd-chain fatty acids (FAs) are a type of valuable lipid with various applications: they can serve as biomarkers, intermediates in the production of flavor and fragrance compounds, fuels, and plasticizers. Microorganisms naturally produce FAs, but such FAs are primarily even-chain; only negligible amounts of odd-chain FAs are generated. As a result, studies using microorganisms to produce odd-chain FAs have had limited success. Here, our objective was to biosynthesize odd-chain FAs de novo in Yarrowia lipolytica using inexpensive carbon sources, namely glucose, without any propionate supplementation. To achieve this goal, we constructed a modular metabolic pathway containing seven genes. In the engineered strain expressing this pathway, the percentage of odd-chain FAs out of total FAs was higher than in the control strain (3.86 vs. 0.84%). When this pathway was transferred into an obese strain, which had been engineered to accumulate large amounts of lipids, odd-chain fatty acid production was 7.2 times greater than in the control (0.05 vs. 0.36 g/L). This study shows that metabolic engineering research is making progress toward obtaining efficient cell factories that produce odd-chain FAs.",

        "abstractText": "Clostridium has great potential in industrial application and medical research. But low DNA repair capacity and plasmids transformation efficiency severely delayed development and application of genetic tools based on homologous recombination (HR). TargeTron is a gene editing technique dependent on the mobility of group II introns, rather than homologous recombination, which made it very suitable for gene disruption of Clostridium. The application of TargeTron technology in Clostridium was academically reported in 2007 and this tool has been introduced in various clostridia as it is easy to operate, time-saving, and reliable. TargeTron has made great progress in solventogenic Clostridium in the aspects of acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation pathway modification, important functional genes identification, and xylose metabolic pathway analysis &amp; reconstruction. In the review, we revisited 12 years' advances of TargeTron technology applicable in solventogenic Clostridium, including its principle, technical characteristics, application and efforts to expand its capabilities, or to avoid potential drawbacks. Some other technologies as putative competitors or collaborators are also discussed. We believe that TargeTron combined with CRISPR/Cas-assisted gene/base editing and gene-expression regulation system will make a better future for clostridial genetic modification.",

        "abstractText": "Free fatty acids are basic oleochemicals implemented in a range of applications including surfactants, lubricants, paints, plastics, and cosmetics. Microbial fatty acid biosynthesis has gained much attention as it provides a sustainable alternative for petrol- and plant oil-derived chemicals. The yeast Starmerella bombicola is a microbial cell factory that naturally employs its powerful lipid metabolism for the production of the biodetergents sophorolipids (&gt;&thinsp;300&nbsp;g/L). However, in this study we exploit the lipidic potential of S. bombicola and convert it from the glycolipid production platform into a free fatty acid cell factory. We used several metabolic engineering strategies to promote extracellular fatty acid accumulation which include blocking competing pathways (sophorolipid biosynthesis and &beta;-oxidation) and preventing free fatty acid activation. The best producing mutant (&Delta;cyp52m1&Delta;faa1&Delta;mfe2) secreted 0.933&nbsp;g/L (&plusmn;&thinsp;0.04) free fatty acids with a majority of C18:1 (43.8%) followed by C18:0 and C16:0 (40.0 and 13.2%, respectively). Interestingly, deletion of SbFaa1 in a strain still producing sophorolipids also resulted in 25% increased de novo sophorolipid synthesis (P&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.0089) and when oil was supplemented to the same strain, a 50% increase in sophorolipid production was observed compared to the wild type (P&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.03). We believe that our work is pivotal for the further development and exploration of S. bombicola as a platform for synthesis of environmentally friendly oleochemicals.",

However, the existing aptamer-ligand biosensors can only function with non-complementary DNA elements that cannot replicate in growing cells. Here, we construct an aptamer-based synthetic regulatory circuit that can dynamically upregulate and downregulate the expression of target genes in response to the ligand thrombin at transcriptional and translational levels, respectively, and further used this system to dynamically engineer the synthesis of 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) in Bacillus subtilis. First, we demonstrated the binding of ligand molecule thrombin with the aptamer can induce the unwinding of fully complementary double-stranded DNA. Based on this finding, we constructed a bifunctional gene expression regulatory circuit using ligand thrombin-bound aptamers. The expression of the reporter gene ranged from 0.084- to 48.1-fold. Finally, by using the bifunctional regulatory circuit, we dynamically upregulated the expression of key genes fkp and futC and downregulated the expression of gene purR, resulting in the significant increase of 2'-FL titer from 24.7 to 674â€¯mg/L. Compared with the other pathway-specific dynamic engineering systems, here the constructed aptamer-based regulatory circuit is independent of pathways, and can be generally used to fine-tune gene expression in other microbes.",

        "abstractText": "Background: Oleaginous yeasts are potent hosts for the renewable production of lipids and harbor great potential for derived products, such as biofuels. Several promising processes have been described that produce hydrocarbon drop-in biofuels based on fatty acid decarboxylation and fatty aldehyde decarbonylation. Unfortunately, besides fatty aldehyde toxicity and high reactivity, the most investigated enzyme, aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase, shows unfavorable catalytic properties which hindered high yields in previous metabolic engineering approaches. Results: To demonstrate an alternative alkane production pathway for oleaginous yeasts, we describe the production of diesel-like, odd-chain alkanes and alkenes, by heterologously expressing a recently discovered light-driven oxidase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) in Yarrowia lipolytica. Initial experiments showed that only strains engineered to have an increased pool of free fatty acids were susceptible to sufficient decarboxylation. Providing these strains with glucose and light in a synthetic medium resulted in titers of 10.9&nbsp;mg/L of hydrocarbons. Using custom 3D printed labware for lighting bioreactors, and an automated pulsed glycerol fed-batch strategy, intracellular titers of 58.7&nbsp;mg/L were achieved. The production of odd-numbered alkanes and alkenes with a length of 17 and 15 carbons shown in previous studies could be confirmed. Conclusions: Oleaginous yeasts such as Yarrowia lipolytica can transform renewable resources such as glycerol into fatty acids and lipids. By heterologously expressing a fatty acid photodecarboxylase from the algae Chlorella variabilis hydrocarbons were produced in several scales from microwell plate to 400&nbsp;mL bioreactors. The lighting turned out to be a crucial factor in terms of growth and hydrocarbon production, therefore, the evaluation of different conditions was an important step towards a tailor-made process.

        "abstractText": "Quorum sensing (QS)-based dynamic regulation has been widely used as basic tool for fine-tuning gene expression in response to cell density changes without adding expensive inducers. However, most reported QS systems primarily relied on down-regulation rather than up-regulation of gene expression, significantly limiting its potential as a molecular switch to control metabolic flux. To solve this challenge, we developed a bifunctional and modular Phr60-Rap60-Spo0A QS system, based on two native promoters, P abrB (down-regulation by Spo0A-P) and P spoiiA (up-regulation by Spo0A-P). We constructed a library of promoters with different capacities to implement down-regulation and up-regulation by changing the location, number, and sequences of the binding sites for Spo0A-P. The QS system can dynamically balance the relationship between efficient synthesis of the target product and cell growth. Finally, we validated the usefulness of this strategy by dynamic control of menaquinone-7 (MK-7) synthesis in Bacillus subtilis 168, a model Gram-positive bacterium, with the bifunctional Phr60-Rap60-Spo0A quorum sensing system. Our dynamic pathway regulation led to a 40-fold improvement of MK-7 production from 9 to 360 mg/L in shake flasks and 200 mg/L in 15-L bioreactor. Taken together, our bilayer QS system has been successfully integrated with biocatalytic functions to achieve dynamic pathway regulation in B.&nbsp;subtilis 168, which may be extended for use in other microbes to fine-tune gene expression and improve metabolites production.",

Synthetic biology approaches offer the ability to genetically engineer these communities to improve the properties of these fermented foods. Soy sauce is a fermented condiment with a vast global market. Engineering members of the microbial communities responsible for soy sauce fermentation may therefore lead to the development of improved products. One important property is the colour of soy sauce, with recent evidence pointing to a consumer preference for more lightly-coloured soy sauce products for particular dishes.ResultsHere we show that a bacterial member of the natural soy sauce fermentation microbial community, Bacillus, can be engineered to reduce the &lsquo;browning&rsquo; reaction during soy sauce production. We show that two approaches result in &lsquo;de-browning&rsquo;: engineered consumption of xylose, an important precursor in the browning reaction, and engineered degradation of melanoidins, the major brown pigments in soy sauce. Lastly, we show that these two strategies work synergistically using co-cultures to result in enhanced de-browning.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate the potential of using synthetic biology and metabolic engineering methods for fine-tuning the process of soy sauce fermentation and indeed for many other natural food and beverage fermentations for improved products.",

However, its n-butanol production from lignocellulosic biomass has yet to be demonstrated. This study demonstrates the construction of a CoA-dependent acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) pathway in C. cellulovorans by introducing genes of adhE1 and ctfA-ctfB-adc from C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824, which enabled it to produce n-butanol using the abundant and low-cost agricultural waste of alkali-extracted, deshelled corn cobs (AECC) as sole carbon source. Then, a novel adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) approach was adapted to strengthen the n-butanol tolerance of C. cellulovorans, to fully utilize its n-butanol output potential. To further improve n-butanol production, both metabolic engineering and evolutionary engineering were combined, using the evolved strain as host for metabolic engineering. The n-butanol production from AECC of the engineered C. cellulovorans enhanced 138-fold from less than 0.025 g/L to 3.47 g/L. This method represents a milestone toward n-butanol production by CBP, using single recombinant clostridia.

In the current research, we investigated the effects of the Ehrlich pathway genetic engineering on higher alcohols production in Y. lipolytica, which directly follows our previous findings concerning elucidation of putative molecular identities involved in this pathway. To this end, we constructed two alternative expression cassettes composed of previously identified genes, putatively involved in the Ehrlich pathway in Y. lipolytica, and cloned them under the control of constitutive pTEF promoter, and by this-released them from extensive native regulation. The effects of the pathway engineering were investigated upon provision of different, Ehrlich pathway-inducing amino acids (L-Phe, L-Leu, L-Ile and L-Val). In general, amplification of the Ehrlich pathway in many cases led to increased formation of a respective higher alcohol from its precursor. We observed interesting effects of aminotransferase BAT2 deletion on synthesis of 2-phenylethanol and its acetate ester, significant relationship between L-Val and L-Phe catabolic pathways, and extensive 'cross-induction' of the derivative compounds synthesis by non-direct precursors.",

        "abstractText": "One of the primary goals of microbial metabolic engineering is to achieve high titer, yield and productivity (TYP) of engineered strains. This TYP index requires optimized carbon flux toward desired molecule with minimal by-product formation. De novo redesign of central carbon and redox metabolism holds great promise to alleviate pathway bottleneck and improve carbon and energy utilization efficiency. The engineered strain, with the overexpression or deletion of multiple genes, typically can&rsquo;t meet the TYP index, due to overflow of central carbon and redox metabolism that compromise the final yield, despite a high titer or productivity might be achieved. To solve this challenge, we reprogramed the central carbon and redox metabolism of Bacillus subtilis and achieved high TYP production of N-acetylglucosamine. Specifically, a &ldquo;push&ndash;pull&ndash;promote&rdquo; approach efficiently reduced the overflown acetyl-CoA flux and eliminated byproduct formation. Four synthetic NAD(P)-independent metabolic routes were introduced to rewire the redox metabolism to minimize energy loss. Implementation of these genetic strategies led us to obtain a B. subtilis strain with superior TYP index. GlcNAc titer in shake flask was increased from 6.6â€¯gâ€¯L&minus;1 to 24.5â€¯gâ€¯L&minus;1, the yield was improved from 0.115 to 0.468â€¯g GlcNAc g&minus;1 glucose, and the productivity was increased from 0.274 to 0.437â€¯gâ€¯L&minus;1 h&minus;1. These titer and yield are the highest levels ever reported and, the yield reached 98% of the theoretical pathway yield (0.478â€¯gâ€¯g&minus;1 glucose). The synthetic redesign of carbon metabolism and redox metabolism represent a novel and general metabolic engineering strategy to improve the performance of microbial cell factories.",

However, folate biofortification of staple crops and dairy products as well as folate bioproduction using metabolically engineered microorganisms are promising alternatives to folic acid supplementation.

Here, we synergistically engineered the carbon metabolism and redox metabolism in the cytosol and mitochondria of a previously engineered Aspergillus oryzae to further improve the l-malate titer and decrease the byproduct succinate concentration. First, the accumulation of the intermediate pyruvate was eliminated by overexpressing a pyruvate carboxylase from Rhizopus oryzae in the cytosol and mitochondria of A.&nbsp;oryzae, and consequently, the l-malate titer increased 7.5%. Then, malate synthesis via glyoxylate bypass in the mitochondria was enhanced, and citrate synthase in the oxidative TCA cycle was downregulated by RNAi, enhancing the l-malate titer by 10.7%. Next, the exchange of byproducts (succinate and fumarate) between the cytosol and mitochondria was regulated by the expression of a dicarboxylate carrier Sfc1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the mitochondria, which increased l-malate titer 3.5% and decreased succinate concentration 36.8%. Finally, an NADH oxidase from Lactococcus lactis was overexpressed to decrease the NADH/NAD+ ratio, and the engineered A.&nbsp;oryzae strain produced 117.2 g/L l-malate and 3.8 g/L succinate, with an l-malate yield of 0.9 g/g corn starch and a productivity of 1.17 g/L/h. Our results showed that synergistic engineering of the carbon and redox metabolisms in the cytosol and mitochondria of A.&nbsp;oryzae effectively increased the l-malate titer, while simultaneously decreasing the concentration of the byproduct succinate.

        "abstractText": "Glucose and xylose are the two most abundant sugars in renewable lignocellulose sources; however, typically they cannot be simultaneously utilized due to carbon catabolite repression. N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is a typical nutraceutical and has many applications in the field of healthcare. Here, we have developed a gene repressor system based on xylose-induced CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) in Bacillus subtilis, aimed at downregulating the expression of three genes (zwf, pfkA, glmM) that control the major competing reactions of GlcNAc synthesis (pentose phosphate pathway (HMP), glycolysis, and peptidoglycan synthesis pathway (PSP)), with the potential to relieve glucose repression and allow the co-utilization of both glucose and xylose. Simultaneous repression of these three genes by CRISPRi improved GlcNAc titer by 13.2% to 17.4â€¯&plusmn;â€¯0.47â€¯g/L, with the GlcNAc yield on glucose and xylose showing an 84.1% improvement, reaching 0.42â€¯&plusmn;â€¯0.036â€¯g/g. In order to further engineer the synergetic utilization of glucose and xylose, a combinatorial approach was developed based on 27 arrays containing sgRNAs with different repression capacities targeting the three genes. We further optimized the temporal control of the system and found that when 15â€¯g/L xylose was added 6â€¯h after inoculation, the most efficient strain, BNX122, synthesized 20.5â€¯&plusmn;â€¯0.85â€¯g/L GlcNAc with a yield of 0.46â€¯&plusmn;â€¯0.010â€¯g/g glucose and xylose in shake flask culture. Finally, the GlcNAc titer and productivity in a 3-L fed-batch bioreactor reached 103.1â€¯&plusmn;â€¯2.11â€¯g/L and 1.17â€¯&plusmn;â€¯0.024â€¯g/L/h, which were 5.0-fold and 2.7-fold of that in shake flask culture, respectively. Taken together, these findings suggest that a CRISPRi-enabled regulation method provides a simple, efficient, and universal way to promote the synergetic utilization of multiple carbon sources by microbial cell factories.",

Yarrowia lipolytica is an oleaginous yeast considered a preferred microorganism for the production of lipid-derived biofuels and chemicals. However, it naturally produces negligible amounts of odd chain fatty acids.Results:The possibility of producing odd FAs using Y. lipolytica was investigated. Y. lipolytica wild-type strain was shown able to grow on weak acids; acetate, lactate, and propionate. Maximal growth rate on propionate reached 0.24&thinsp;&plusmn;&thinsp;0.01 h&minus;1 at 2 g/L, and growth inhibition occurred at concentration above 10 g/L. Wild-type strain accumulated lipids ranging from 7.39 to 8.14% (w/w DCW) depending on the carbon source composition, and odd FAs represented only 0.01&ndash;0.12 g/L. We here proved that the deletion of the PHD1 gene improved odd FAs production, which reached a ratio of 46.82% to total lipids. When this modification was transferred to an obese strain, engineered for improving lipid accumulation, further increase odd FAs production reaching a total of 0.57 g/L was shown. Finally, a fed-batch co-feeding strategy was optimized for further increase odd FAs production, which generated 0.75 g/L, the best production described so far in Y. lipolytica.Conclusions:A Y. lipolytica strain able to accumulate high level of odd chain fatty acids, mainly heptadecenoic acid, has been successfully developed. In addition, a fed-batch co-feeding strategy was optimized to further improve lipid accumulation and odd chain fatty acid content. These lipids enriched in odd chain fatty acid can (1) improve the properties of the biodiesel generated from Y. lipolytica lipids and (2) be used as renewable source of odd chain fatty acid for industrial applications. This work paves the way for further improvements in odd chain fatty acids and fatty acid-derived compound production.",

We further increased the lipid content by overexpressing heterologousgenes to facilitate the conversion of xylose-derived metabolites into lipid precursors. Finally, we showed that theseengineered strains were able to grow and produce lipids in a very high yield (lipid content = 67%, titer = 16.5 g/L,yield = 3.44 g/g sugars, productivity 1.85 g/L/h) on a xylose-rich agave bagasse hydrolysate in spite of toxiccompounds.Conclusions: This work demonstrates the potential of metabolic engineering to reduce the costs of lipid productionfrom inexpensive substrates as source of fuels and chemicals.",

Rhodotorula (Rhodosporidium) toruloides is a yeast that naturally synthesizes substantial amounts of specialty chemicals and has been recently engineered to (i) enhance its natural production of lipids and carotenoids, and (ii) produce novel industrially relevant compounds. The use of R. toruloides by companies and research groups has exponentially increased in recent years as a result of recent improvements in genetic engineering techniques and the availability of multiomics information on its genome and metabolism. This review focuses on recent engineering approaches in R. toruloides for bioproduction and explores its potential as a biotechnological chassis.",

Yarrowia lipolytica, is an industrial organism unable to naturally synthesize carotenoids but with the ability to produce high amounts of the precursor Acetyl-CoA. We first found that a lipid overproducer strain was capable of producing more &beta;-carotene than a wild type after expressing the heterologous pathway. Thereafter, we developed a combinatorial synthetic biology approach base on Golden Gate DNA assembly to screen the optimum promoter-gene pairs for each transcriptional unit expressed. The best strain reached a production titer of 1.5&thinsp;g/L and a maximum yield of 0.048&thinsp;g/g of glucose in flask. &beta;-carotene production was further increased in controlled conditions using a fed-batch fermentation. A total production of &beta;-carotene of 6.5&thinsp;g/L and 90&thinsp;mg/g DCW with a concomitant production of 42.6&thinsp;g/L of lipids was achieved. Such high titers suggest that engineered Y. lipolytica is a competitive producer organism of &beta;-carotene.",

        "abstractText": "Triacylglycerol (TAG) and glycogen are the two major metabolites for carbon storage in most eukaryotic organisms. We investigated the glycogen metabolism of the oleaginous Y. lipolytica and found that this yeast accumulates up to 16% glycogen in its biomass. Assuming that elimination of glycogen synthesis would result in an improvement of lipid accumulation, we characterized and deleted the single gene coding for glycogen synthase, YlGSY1. The mutant was grown under lipogenic conditions with glucose and glycerol as substrates and we obtained up to 60% improvement in TAG accumulation compared to the wild type strain. Additionally, YlGSY1 was deleted in a background that was already engineered for high lipid accumulation. In this obese background, TAG accumulation was also further increased. The highest lipid content of 52% was found after 3 days of cultivation in nitrogen-limited glycerol medium. Furthermore, we constructed mutants of Y. lipolytica and S. cerevisiae that are deleted for both glycogen and TAG synthesis, demonstrating that the ability to store carbon is not essential. Overall, this work showed that glycogen synthesis is a competing pathway for TAG accumulation in oleaginous yeasts and that deletion of the glycogen synthase has beneficial effects on neutral lipid storage.",

However, it is unable to consume xylose, the major pentose in lignocellulosic hydrolysates, which are considered a preferred carbon source for bioprocesses due to their low cost, wide abundance and high sugar content. Here, we engineered Y. lipolytica to metabolize xylose to produce lipids or citric acid. The overexpression of xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase from Scheffersomyces stipitis were necessary but not sufficient to permit growth. The additional overexpression of the endogenous xylulokinase enabled identical growth as the wild type strain in glucose. This mutant was able to produce up to 80 g/L of citric acid from xylose. Transferring these modifications to a lipid-overproducing strain boosted the production of lipids from xylose. This is the first step towards a consolidated bioprocess to produce chemicals and fuels from lignocellulosic materials.",

        "abstractText": "BackgroundThe industrial production of riboflavin mostly relies on the microbial fermentation of flavinogenic microorganisms and Ashbya gossypii is the main industrial producer of the vitamin. Accordingly, bioengineering strategies aimed at increasing riboflavin production in A. gossypii are highly valuable for industry.ResultsWe analyze the contribution of all the RIB genes to the production of riboflavin in A. gossypii. Two important metabolic rate-limiting steps that limit the overproduction of riboflavin have been found: first, low mRNA levels of the RIB genes hindered the overproduction of riboflavin; second, the competition of the AMP branch for purinogenic precursors also represents a limitation for riboflavin overproduction. Thus, overexpression of the RIB genes resulted in a significant increase in riboflavin yield. Moreover, both the inactivation and the underexpression of the ADE12 gene, which controls the first step of the AMP branch, also proved to have a positive effect on riboflavin production. Accordingly, a strain that combines both the overexpression of the RIB genes and the underexpression of the ADE12 gene was engineered. This strain produced 523 mg/L of riboflavin (5.4-fold higher than the wild-type), which is the highest titer of riboflavin obtained by metabolic engineering in A. gossypii so far.ConclusionsRiboflavin production in A. gossypii is limited by a low transcription activity of the RIB genes. Flux limitation towards AMP provides committed substrate GTP for riboflavin overproduction without detrimental effects on biomass formation. A multiple-engineered Ashbya strain that produces up to 523 mg/L of riboflavin was generated.",
